Let us consider the [[Friedmann Equation|Friedmann equation]] for an empty universe, but with some vacuum energy 

$\frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2} = \frac{G u}{c^2} - \frac{k c^2}{R^2}$

where $u$ is the vacuum energy density. We also consider a closed universe, so $k>0$. Such a universe has to be larger than some finite size

$R_c = \sqrt{\frac{k}{G u}} c^2$

The left hand side of the Friedman equation is always positive, and the right hand side becomes negative when $R<R_c$.

It has been suggested that a universe can get from size $R=0$ to size $R>R_c$ using quantum tunneling. If we ignore the minus sign and try to solve for the velocity in the forbidden zone $R \ll R_c$ we get

$|\dot{R}| \approx \sqrt{k} c$

The effective mass of the universe is given by dimensional analysis

$M \approx R_c^3 \frac{u}{c^2} \approx \frac{k^{3/2} c^4}{G^{3/2} \sqrt{u}}$

The magnitude of the momentum in the forbidden zone is $|p| \approx |\dot{R}| M$, and the tunneling probability is

$P \approx \exp \left(- B\right)$

where 

$B \approx \frac{p R_c}{\hbar} \approx \frac{k^{5/2} c^7}{G^2 u \hbar}$
