Let us consider an electron that scatters off of a proton. We denote the velocity at infinity by $v$, and the impact parameter by $b$. If the deflection angle is small ($ m_e v2 \gg q^2/b$, where $m_e$ is the mass of the electron and $q$ is the elementary charge) then this scattering gives rise to [[Bremsstrahlung - Free free emission|free free emission]]. In this entry we will focus on the case where the deflection angle is of order unity. The strongest radiation is emitted from electrons who come closest to the proton. Because of the uncertainty principle, the effective distance between the electron and proton cannot drop below the Bohr radius $r_b$. At this distance the radial acceleration is

$ a \approx \frac{q^2}{m_e r_b^2} \approx \alpha^4 \frac{c^2}{r_e}$

Where $r_e \approx q^2/m_e c^2$ is the classical electron radius, $c$ is the speed of light, $r_b \approx r_e/\alpha^2$ and $ \alpha $ is the fine structure constant. The Larmor luminosity is given by

$ L \approx \frac{q^2}{c^3} a^2 \approx \alpha^8 m_e c^2 \frac{c}{r_e}$

The time the electron spends at distances comparable to the Bohr radius is

$ t_b \approx \sqrt{\frac{m_e r_b^3}{q^2}} \approx \frac{1}{\alpha^3} \frac{c}{r_e} $

The amount of energy radiated in a single collision is

$ \Delta U \approx L \cdot t_b \approx \alpha^5 m_e c^5 $

A scattering where the minimum distance equal to the Bohr radius occurs when the impact parameter is

$ b v \approx \frac{\hbar}{m_e} \Rightarrow b \approx \frac{r_e}{\alpha} \frac{c}{v} $

Where $ \hbar $ is the Planck constant and $ \alpha \approx \frac{q^2}{\hbar c} $. The emissivity is given by

$ \varepsilon_{bf} \approx \Delta U n^2 v b^2 \approx \alpha^3 \frac{m_e c^3}{r_e^4} \left(n r_e^3\right)^2 \sqrt{\frac{m_e c^2}{k T}}$

Where $n$ is the number density, $T$ is the temperature, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $ v \approx \sqrt{k T/m_e} $ is the thermal velocity of the electrons.
