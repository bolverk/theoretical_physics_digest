Let us consider a spherical star cluster of mass $M$ and radius $R$. Suppose that ta point mass $m$ moves at a velocity $v$ and passes within a distance $b>R$ of the cluster. We assume that the velocity of the perturber is fast enough such that the scattering angles are small. As a result of this interaction the centre of mass of the cluster will acquire a velocity

$v_{cm} \approx \frac{G m}{b v}$

In addition, the interaction will also induce a linear velocity field in the cluster, such that the difference between velocities on opposite sides of the cluster are 

$\Delta v \approx \frac{G m R}{b^2 v}$

The energy of the cluster therefore increases by

$\Delta U \approx M \Delta v^2$

The cluster responds to heating by either increasing the radius by $\Delta R$ or by losing mass $\Delta M$. Both are comparable to the ratio between the extra energy and the binding energy $U \approx G M^2/R$

$\frac{\Delta M}{M} \approx \frac{\Delta R}{R} \approx \frac{\Delta U}{U} \approx \frac{R^3}{b^2}\frac{m}{M} \frac{G m}{v^2 b}$
