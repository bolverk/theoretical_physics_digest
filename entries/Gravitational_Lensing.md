Suppose a photon passes near a massive object of mass $ M $ with impact parameter $ b $. We assume that the energy of the photon is much greater than the gravitational energy at closest approach $ c \gg \sqrt{\frac{G M}{b}} $ where $ c $ is the speed of light in vacuo and $ G $ is the universal constant of gravity. We further assume that the trajectory remains a straight line, and the deviations from it are very small. Let us denote by $ x $ the coordinate along the photons trajectory, such that the unperturbed trajectory is $ x = c*t $ (i.e. the point of closest approach occurs at $ t = 0 $). The lion's share of deflection occurs in the range $ x \in \left[-b,b\right] $. The time the photon spends in this range is $ \Delta t = \frac{2b}{c} $, and the average acceleration is $ a = \frac{GM}{b^2} $, so the velocity difference is $ \Delta v = a \Delta t = \frac{2GM}{cb} $. The thrust can also be calculated in a more rigorous way by integrating over the entire path

$ \Delta v = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{G M b}{\left(b^2+c^2 t^2 \right)^{3/2}}dt = \frac{2 G M}{b c} $

Interestingly, we get the same result. The deflection angle can be estimated by

$ \alpha = \frac{\Delta v}{c} = \frac{2 G M}{b c^2} = \frac{R_s}{b} $

where $ R_s $ is the Schwarzschild radius. In retrospect, we could have guessed this result from dimensional analysis. We note that this results is smaller by a factor of two from the deflection angle derived from general relativity.
