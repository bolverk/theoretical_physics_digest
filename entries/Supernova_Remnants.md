Supernova remnants is a collective name for changes in the environment of the progenitor due to the explosion. It is usually divided into three phases. The first is the ejecta dominated stage. At this stage the ejecta are in ballistic motion (constant velocity). It ends when the swept up mass is the same order of magnitude as the ejecta mass. For a supernova energy $ E_e = 10^{51} erg $, ejecta mass of $ M_e = 1 M_{\odot} $ and an environment where the density is uniform and equal to $ n \approx 1 \frac{1}{cm^3} $ , the end of the ejecta dominated stage is at a radius of about [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%281+solar+mass%29%2F%281+proton+mass%29*%281+cc%29%29^%281%2F3%29%2F%281+parsec%29 3.4 parsec]. Since the velocity is uniform and can be approximated as $ v_e \approx \sqrt{\frac{E_e}{M_e} } $, this phase lasts for about [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%281+solar+mass%29%2F%281+proton+mass%29*%281+cc%29%29^%281%2F3%29%2Fsqrt%28%281e51+erg%29%2F%281+solar+mass%29%29 500 years].
