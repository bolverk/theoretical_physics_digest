The radius of regular stars can be estimated from their luminosity $L$ and their temperature $T$ using Blackbody relations

$ L \approx \sigma R^2 T^4 \Rightarrow R \approx \frac{\sqrt{L}}{\sqrt{\sigma} T^2}$

where $ \sigma $ is the Stefan Boltzmann constant. In the case of neutron stars, gravitational redshift can distort the result. An observer at infinite distance from the neutron star would measure different energies and different timescales from those emitted on the surface of the neutron star by [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105485 a factor of]

$ \frac{\varepsilon_{\infty}}{\varepsilon} = \frac{t}{t_{\infty}} = \sqrt{1 - R_g/R} $

where values with underscore $ \infty $ represent values measured by an observer at infinity, $ R $ is the radius of the neutron star, $ R_g = 2 G M/R $ is the gravitational radius, $ G $ is the gravitational constant and $ M $ is the mass of the neutron star. The observed luminosity is
$ L_{\infty} = L \left(1-R_g/R\right)$
and the observed temperature is
$ T_{\infty} = T \sqrt{1-R_g/R\right)$
The inferred radius is
$ R_{\infty} \approx \frac{\sqrt{L_{\infty}}}{\sqrt{\sigma} T_{\infty}^2} \approx R / \sqrt{1-R_g/R}$
