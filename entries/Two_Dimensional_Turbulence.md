In the case of two dimensional, incompressible turbulence, there are two constants of motion: vorticity and energy. Energy conservation gives rise to the [[Kolmogorov Turbulence|Kolmogorov]] spectrum. The spectrum governed by vorticity can be calculated in the following way. Vorticity in two dimensions can be described by the following scalar field

$ \omega = \hat{z} \cdot \nabla \times \vec{v} $

where $ z $ is a direction normal to the plane of motion, $ \vec{v} $ is the velocity field. Applying Fourier transform, and using the fact that the flow is incompressible yields

$ \omega = v k \Rightarrow v \propto k^{-1} $

The energy density per wavenumber is

$ E \approx \frac{v^2}{k} \propto k^{-3} $.

If the turbulence is stirred at a certain scale, then the $ k^{-3} $ spectrum extends to smaller wavelengths (higher wave numbers), and the $ k^{-5/3} $ extends to larger wavelengths (smaller wave numbers). In this case, the energy density vanishes at large wave numbers, and the vorticity vanishes at small wave numbers.
