Thomson scattering is the elastic scattering of radiation from a free electron. The cross section for this process, known as the Thomson cross section is often encountered in various radiative processes.

The cross section is given by
$ \sigma_T = \frac{8\pi}{3} r_0^2 $

where $r_0 = e^2 / m_e c^2$ is the electron's classical radius.

Here we derive this result, to within an order of magnitude.

Consider an incoming electromagnetic wave, with angular frequency $ \omega $, and an electric field amplitude $ E_0 $. Assuming that the charge is moving at sub-relativistic velocities, we neglect the effect of the corresponding magnetic field. The Lorentz force will be smaller by a factor of $ v_e/c $ compared with the electric force, and is hence negligible.

The electron will thus experience an acceleration of order
$ a = e E_0 / m_e $

where $ m_e $ is the electron mass, and hence the second time-derivative of its dipole moment is roughly <math \ddot{d} \approx e a <nowiki>$</nowiki>.

Using the [[Larmor formula]], the power of the radiation emitted by the accelerating charge is given by

$ P = \frac{(\ddot{d})^2}{c^3} \approx a^2 e^2 / c^3 = \frac{e^4 E_0^2}{m_e^2 c^3}$

where the acceleration $a$ was substituted.

Finally, the flux of incoming radiation is roughly $ F = E_0^2 c $ - the Electric field energy density is $E_0^2 / 8\pi$. The scattering cross section is given by

$ \sigma_T = \frac{P}{c E_0^2} \approx \frac{e^4}{m_e^2 c^4} = r_0^2 $
