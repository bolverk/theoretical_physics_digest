A particle moving in one direction enduring radiation perpendicular to its direction of motion will feel a force in the opposite direction to its motion. This force is the Poynting Robertson effect, and it is a relativistic effect. It can be easily understood if one thinks of the problem in the particle's reference frame. In that frame the photons travel at a different angle. Unfortunately, the interpretation is not that simple in the lab frame. There is a common misconception that the braking is due to an asymmetric emission by the particle. However, as we show below, the phenomenon can be explained without emission at al.

== Rest Frame ==
Suppose a particle is moving in the $ \hat{x} $ direction with a velocity $ v \ll c $. Suppose further that it is in a radiation field with photons moving in the $ \hat{y} $ direction. In the particle's rest frame the 4 - momentum (actually 3 momentum because we only consider 2 spatial dimensions)

$ \left(\begin{matrix}
\epsilon'
\\ 
{p'}_x
\\ 
{p'}_y
\end{matrix} \right ) 
=
\left( \begin{matrix}
\gamma & \gamma \beta & 0 \\ 
\gamma \beta & \gamma & 0 \\ 
0  & 0  & 1 
\end{matrix} \right )
\left(\begin{matrix}
\epsilon
\\ 
0
\\ 
\epsilon
\end{matrix} \right ) =
\epsilon \left(\begin{matrix}
\gamma
\\ 
\gamma \beta
\\ 
1
\end{matrix} \right ) 
$

The number of incident photons within a time interval is $ n c \Delta t R^2 $, where $ n $ is their density, $ c $ is the speed of light, $ \Delta t $ is the time interval and $ R $ is the radius of the particle. All in all, the change in the x component of the momentum is

$ \Delta {p'_x} = - \frac{\epsilon}{c} \beta n c \Delta R^2 = \frac{v}{c^2} f = \left( \frac{R}{r} \right)^2 \frac{L}{c^2} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}} \Delta t$ 

where $ f $ is the energy flux of the photons. The last transition assumes the particle circles a star at a distance $ R $. The mass of the star is $ M $ and its luminosity is $ L $. The force is therefore given by

$ F_{PR} = \frac{\Delta {p'}_x}{\Delta t} \approx = \left( \frac{R}{r} \right)^2 \frac{L}{c^2} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}} $
