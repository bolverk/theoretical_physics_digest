Let us consider a particle moving with velocity $ \beta c $, where $ c $ is the speed of light. Photons emitted from the particles at a small enough angle (relative to the direction of motion) will overtake the particle, while photons emitted at large angles will lag behind. The critical angle at which photons can "keep up" with the particle is

$ c \beta = c \cos \theta $

For a particle moving very close to the speed of light $ \beta \rightarrow 1 $

$ \theta \approx \frac{1}{\gamma} $

where $ \gamma^2 = 1/\left(1-\beta^2\right) $. Most of the photons eminating from that particle will be concentrated in a cone with an opening angle which get narrower as the particle moves faster. This is called relativistic beaming.

This effect can be suppressed in a medium with a refracive index smaller than unity $ n $. In this case, the minimum angle is given by

$ c \beta = \frac{c}{n} \cos \theta $

Even in the limit $ \beta \rightarrow 1 $, the angle remains finite

$ \cos \theta \approx n $

Hence, beaming is suppressed for velocities larger than $ \beta > n $.
