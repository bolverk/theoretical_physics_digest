Simulations and observations reveal a tight correlation between the density and the temperature of the intergalactic medium (see this [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay127/readings/McQuinn_IGM_2016ARAA53p313.pdf review] for more details). This correlation can be explained as a balance between heating and cooling of the intergalactic medium. Cooling is due to Hubble expansion, so it is linear in the temperature and the density

$C \propto n T$
Heating is due to recombination, so it is quadratic in the density

$H \propto n^2$
A semi - classical [[bound free emission|derivation]] gives

$H \propto T^{-1/2}$
but a more detailed calculation gives a slightly steeper dependence on the temperature

$H \propto T^{-0.7}$
By comparing the heating and the cooling rates, we obtain

$n \propto T^{1.7}$

which is in agreement with the observations.
