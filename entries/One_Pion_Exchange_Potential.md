In 1935 Hideki Yukawa proposed that the strong nuclear force is mediated by a massive particle particle, and proposed the following form for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_potential potential]

$ V \left(r\right) = -g^2 \frac{\exp \left(-r\lambda\right)}{r} $

where $ \lambda = \hbar/m_m c $ is the Compton wavelength of the mediating particle, $ \hbar $ is the reduced planck constant, $ c $ is the speed of light and $m_m$ is the mass of the mediator. In the limit $ \lambda \rightarrow \infty $ this expression reproduces the Coulomb potential, and the exponential term can be interpreted as the tunnelling probability for the mediating particle. A suitable mediating particle - the pion - was detected in 1947, and so $m_m = m_{\pi}$. It was later found that nucleons have internal structure and are made up of quarks, and so the Yukawa theory cannot be a complete description of the strong force, but it is still a useful approximation.

What's left is to constrain the coupling constant $g$. If the mediating particle was a scalar particle (zero spin and positive parity), then the coupling constant would have been

$ g^2 \approx \hbar c $

One way of understanding this coupling constant is as follows. When two nucleons are at a distance $ r $ they communicate by exchanging particle whose de Broglie wavelength is comparable to $ r $, so their momentum is $ \hbar/r $, and if they are relativistic their energy is $ \hbar c / r $. However, the pion is not a scalar, but a rather a pseudo scalar, meaning its spin is zero but its parity is negative. This pairity precludes spherically symmetric s-wave scattering (angular momentum $ l = 0 $). The next leading order in the [http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/752.mf1i.spring03/Scattering_II.htm partial wave expansion] is p-wave (with angular momentum $ l = 1 $), which is suppressed by the ratio of the Compton wavelengths squared of the particles and mediators. Hence,

$ g^2 \approx \hbar c \left(\frac{m_{\pi}}{m_n}\right)^2 $

where $ m_n $ is the mass of a nucleon. When the nucleons are at a distance comparable to the pion Compton wavelength, the binding energy is

$ V \left(\frac{\hbar}{m_{\pi} c}\right) \approx m_{\pi} c^2 \left(\frac{m_{\pi}}{m_n}\right)^2 $
