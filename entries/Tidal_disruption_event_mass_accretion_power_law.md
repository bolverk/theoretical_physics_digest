Let us consider a star orbiting a black hole (or any compact, massive object) such that the center of mass of the orbiting star is on a parabolic trajectory, i.e. its total energy (kinetic + potential) is zero. In this case, the star will be tidally disrupted, a portion of it will be accretted into the black hole and the remainder will be expelled. If we denote that accreted mass by $ M $, the time by $ t $ and the energy of each fluid particle by $ E $, then we get

$ \frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{dM}{dE} \cdot \frac{dE}{dt} $

We assume that $ \frac{dM}{dE} $ is constant. The other derivative can be estimated using $ \frac{dE}{dt} \approx \frac{E}{\tau} $ where $ \tau $ is the period. The relation between the period to the energy in a Keplerian orbit is

$ E \propto a^{-1} \propto \omega^{2/3} \propto \tau^{-2/3} $

Where $ a $ is the separation between the stars, and $ \omega> $ is the angular velocity. Finally we get

$ \frac{dM}{dt} \propto \frac{E}{\tau} \propto \tau^{-5/3} \propto t^{-5/3} $
