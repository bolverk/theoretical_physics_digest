The Yarkovsky effect is a mechanism that can change the angular momentum of an object (asteroid) orbiting a luminous gravitating mass (star). The object absorbs radiation in the radial direction (i.e. along the line connecting it to the luminous mass), but might emit it in a different angle $ \alpha $ (measured relative to the radial direction). This effect is strongest if the radiation is emitted perpendicular to the radial direction $ \alpha = \frac{\pi}{2} $. This case sets an upper limit for the torque this effect can exert. Suppose the luminosity of the star is $ \dot{E}_s $. The maximum energy the asteroid can absorb is

$ \dot{E}_a \approx \dot{E}_s \left( \frac{R}{d} \right)^2 $

if $ R $ is the size of the asteroid and $ d $ is its distance from the star. The force is given by $ F \approx \frac{\dot{E}_d}{c} $, and the torque is therefore

$ \dot{L} \approx F \cdot d \approx \frac{\dot{E}_s}{c} \left( \frac{R}{d} \right)^2 d $

This effect will only be relevant for objects that can significantly change their angular momentum within the lifetime of the system. The time scale for a significant change of the angular momentum is

$ \tau \approx \frac{L}{\dot{L}} \approx \frac{M_a v_a d}{\frac{\dot{E}}{c} \left( \frac{R}{d} \right)^2 d} \approx \frac{\rho R d^2 c \sqrt{G M_s/d}}{\dot{E}_s} $

where $ \rho $ is the mass of the asteroid, $ M_s $ is the mass of the star. For an object of size $ R = 1 km $, density $ \rho = 1 g / cc $, at a distance of $ d = 1 AU $ emitting at solar luminosity this time scale is about [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281+gram%2Fcc%29*%281+km%29*%281+au%29^2*%28speed+of+light%29*sqrt%28%28gravitation+constant%29*%28solar+mass%29%2F%281+au%29%29%2F%28solar+luminosity%29 10 million years].
