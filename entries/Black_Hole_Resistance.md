A black hole introduced into an environment with a uniform electric field will distort the electric field lines in the same way as an imperfect conductor will. The resistance can be estimated using dimensional analysis. The units of resistance is inverse velocity. In the context of black holes the only relevant velocity scale is the speed of light, and hence the resistance is

$ R \approx c^{-1} $

where $ c $ is the speed of light.
