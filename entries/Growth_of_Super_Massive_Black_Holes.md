Black holes can be divided into two groups. The first is stellar mass black holes. These were created as a result of a stellar collapse, and therefore have a mass of a few solar masses. The other group is super massive black holes. The masses in this group range between 1e6 and 1e10 solar masses. It is very unlikely that a super massive black hole was created in a single event, but rather they started as stellar black holes, and accreted the remaining mass. In this page we will discuss a few models and limits for black hole growths.
