Kelvin Helmholtz time scale is an estimate of the time it takes a star to collapse after nuclear burning ceases. This time scale is obtained by taking the ratio of the gravitational binding energy and the luminosity

$ t_{KH} = \frac{GM^2}{RL} $

where $ G $ is the gravitation constant, $ M $ is the mass of the star, $ R $ is its radius and $ L $ its luminosity.
For example, the Kelvin Helmholtz time of our sun is about [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28gravitation+constant%29*%28solar+mass%29^2%2F%28solar+luminosity%29%2F%28solar+radius%29 30 million years].
