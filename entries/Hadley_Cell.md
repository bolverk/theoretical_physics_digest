Let us consider some planet with radius $ R $, rotating with frequency $ \Omega $. The planet has an atmosphere with a scale height $ H $ and surface density $ g $. Let us consider a packet of hot gas rising up from the surface of the planet to one scale height. The average velocity of the gas is $ v_{b} \approx \sqrt{g H} $. If we consider multiple plumes of gas, one at the equator and another at lattitude $ \phi $, then the difference in velocity between them is $ \Delta v \approx \Omega R \phi^2 $. The lattitude where both scales are equal is 

$ v_b \approx \Delta v \Rightarrow \phi \approx \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{g H}}{R \Omega}} $

The region in between the equator and this lattitude is called a Hadley cell. In the case of the earth it is of the order of 25 degrees.
