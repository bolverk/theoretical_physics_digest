Hyper velocity stars are starts that travel at a much faster rate then the Galactic keplerian velocity. They are thought to start our as a member of a binary that enters a black hole and is tidally torn apart. We will first calculate the distance from the black hole at which the rapture occurs. Suppose we have a symmetric binary, i.e. two equal mass stars (both of mass $ m $) in a circular orbit around each other, separated by a distance $ a $. The frequency of rotation is 

$ \omega \approx \sqrt{\frac{G m}{a^3}} $

When this binary approaches a massive object $ M $, each of the star will experience a slightly difference force. The difference between the force on each star, to that experienced by the centre of mass is

$ \Delta F = \frac{G M m}{r^2} \frac{a}{r} $

where $ r $ is the distance between the massive object and the binary centre of mass. The velocity difference acquired within one period is

$ \Delta v = \frac{\Delta F}{m \omega} = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}} \left( \frac{M}{m}\right)^{1/2} \left( \frac{a}{r}\right)^{5/2} $

We assume that the binary breaks up when the rotation velocity changes drastically within a single period. If the change in velocity is too slow then the stars will have enough time to swap places, and the difference between them will average out. Hence, breakup occurs when

$ a \omega \approx \Delta v \Rightarrow r = a \left(\frac{M}{m} \right)^{1/6}$
