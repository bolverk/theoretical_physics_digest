Charged particles accelerated by a magnetic field will radiate due to Larmour's formula. For non-relativistic electrons the frequency of radiation is simply the gyration frequency:

$ \nu_{cyc}=\frac{eB}{2 \pi m_e c}=3\times 10^{-9} \frac{B}{\mbox{mGauss}}\mbox{GHz} $

and the radiation is cyclotron which is relatively weak.

For relativistic electrons, the radiation is Synchrotron, which scans a wide range of frequencies and is more powerful. Three different effects modify the cyclotron typical frequency to give the synchrotron one:
# For relativistic particles, the effective mass is $ \gamma $ times larger, causing the gyration frequency to be smaller by $ \gamma $
