When an observer moves with velocity $ w $ through an isotropic cloud , she will notice an anisotropy in the incident particle flux. The anisotropy is measured by the ratio of the difference of the extreme fluxes to the sum of the extremes

$ \xi = \frac{f_{\max} - f_{\min}}{f_{\max} + f_{\min}} $

If the velocity of the observer is much smaller than the typical velocity of the particles in the cloud $ v $ , the anisotropy will be linear in the ratio of the velocities

$ \xi \propto \frac{w}{v} $
