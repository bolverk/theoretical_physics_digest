Let us consider a homologously expanding sphere of completely ionised plasma and radiation, and denote the time since the beginning of the expansion by $ t $. Suppose that at some point random fluctuations create a slightly over - dense region of size $ R $. This region expands with a velocity $ R/t $. If photons diffuse out faster than the region expands, then this region will equilibrate temperature and density, and the over - density will disappear. If photon diffusion is slower than the expansion, then the over density will persist. The critical size is given by

$ \frac{c t}{R} \approx R \sigma n \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{c t}{\sigma n}} $

where $ c $ is the speed of light, $ \sigma $ is the Thompson cross section and $ n $ is the average number density of the charged particles. The minimum mass that can persists is given by

$ M \approx m n R^3 \approx m_p \sqrt{\frac{c^3 t^3}{\sigma^3 n}} $

where $ m $ is the mass of the proton.
