== Energy Limit ==
The mass effluence from a star is limited by the incoming energy from a nearby star. Suppose that the nearby star emits energy at a rate $ L $. If the planet is at a distance $ r $ from the star, and its radius is $ R $, then total incoming energy per unit time is

$ \frac{L}{4 \pi r^2} = \pi R^2 \dot{E} \Rightarrow \dot{E} = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{R}{r} \right)^2 $

Matter is ejected from the star at the escape velocity

$ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{G M_p}{R}} \approx \sqrt{G \rho} R $

where $ \rho $ is the average density of the planet. If the planet has no other way of dissipating this energy, it must expel wind, and the mass loss will be limited by

$ \dot{M} \approx \frac{\dot{E}}{v_e^2} \approx \frac{L}{r^2 G \rho} $

This calculation assumes that the scale height of the atmosphere is much smaller than the radius of the planet.
