Let us consider a black hole with dimensionless spin $a$, embedded in a plasma and a uniform magnetic field $B$. Due to the Lens - Thirring effect, the black hole will exert a torque on the particles and accelerate them in the direction of motion. Lenz' force will then act to push the particles either away or toward the black hole, depending on the charge. This will make the black hole absorb more particles with the same charge, and so the net charge on the black hole will increase. This process will stop when the electrostatic force of the black hole becomes comparable to Lenz' force.

$ \frac{Q}{R^2} \approx B v/c $

where $Q$ is the charge of the black hole, $ R $ is its gravitational radius and $v \approx a c$ is the induced azimuthal velocity. Solving for the charge yields

$ Q \approx a B R^2 $
