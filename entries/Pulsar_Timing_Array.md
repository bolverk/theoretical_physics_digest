A pulsar timing array is a proposed method to use high precision observation of pulsars to detect gravitational waves. Suppose we are observing a pulsar that, undisturbed, emits pulses at regular intervals. Now suppose gravitational waves sweep across the pulsar. Due to the gravitational waves, the position of the pulsar will oscillate with time, causing the interval between observed pulses to change. The luminosity of gravitational waves from symmetric binary in a circular orbit is given by

$ L \approx \frac{M^2 a^4 \omega^6}{c^5/G} $

where $ M $ is the mass of each member, $ a $ is the semi major axis, $ \omega $ is the orbital frequency, $ c $ is the speed of light and $ G $ is the constant of gravity.

In order to calculate the displacement due to the gravitational waves, let us consider two particles falling unto some gravitating point mass $ m $ from a distance $ R $. If the radial separation between the particles in $ R \ll x $, then the tidal acceleration is

$ a \approx \frac{G M}{R^3} x $

So the relative change in distance per unit time, or straing rate is

$ \dot{h} \approx \sqrt{\frac{a}{x}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R^3}} \approx \sqrt{G \rho} $

So we've established an equivalence between a strain rate and a corresponding effective mass density $ \rho $.

At a distance $ r $ from a gravitational wave source, the energy density is $ L/\left(c r^2\right) $. The energy density associated with a strain rate is $ \rho c^2 \approx \dot{h}^2 c^2 /G $. Now we can solve for the strain rate

$ \dot{h} \approx \frac{G M a^2 \omega^3}{r c^4} $

Using Kepler's law $ a \approx \left(G M/\omega^2\right)^{1/3} $ and assuming $ \dot{h} \approx \omega h $ we can find the amplitude of the strain

$ h \approx \frac{G^{5/3} M^{5/3} \omega^{2/3}}{r c^4} $

The wavelength of the gravitational wave is $ \lambda \approx c/\omega $, so the displacement of the pular is $ \Delta L \approx h \lambda $ so the time delay is

$ \Delta t \approx \frac{\Delta L}{c} \approx \frac{G^{5/3} M^{5/3}}{r c^4 \omega^{1/3}} $

For typical parameters $ M \approx 10^9 M_{\odot} $, $ r \approx 1 \, \rm Gpc $ and $ \omega \approx 10^{-7} \, \rm Hz $ the time delay is of the order of a few nano seconds.
