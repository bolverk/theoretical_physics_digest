Let us consider a giant star, where the core and envelope are roughly the same mass $M$. We denote the radius of the core by $R$. From the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and ideal gas equation of state (for the material outside the core) we get the temperature close to the core

$k_b T \approx \frac{G M \mu}{R}$

where $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, $G$ is the gravitation constant and $\mu$ is the atomic mass. Radiative transfer relates the temperature to the luminosity

$L \approx \frac{\sigma T^4}{\tau} \approx \frac{\sigma T^4 R^2}{\kappa \rho R}$

Where $\sigma$ is the Stefan Boltzmann constant and $\kappa$ is the opacity (which, for simplicity we assume to be constant). We also assume that the nuclear reaction rate per unit mass is given by $\varepsilon \propto \rho T^{\nu}$, so the total luminosity is given by

$L \propto R^3 \rho^2 T^{\nu}$

We can isolate the density

$\rho \propto T^{\frac{4-\nu}{3}} R^{-2/3}$

and then we can obtain an expression for the luminosity

$L \propto M^{\frac{\nu + 8}{3}} R^{-1-\frac{\nu}{3}}$

Since the core is degenerate we can simplify this expression further by eliminating the radius $R \propto M^{-1/3}$

$L \propto M^{\frac{4 \nu}{9}+3}$

For the CNO cycle $\nu \approx 18$ so

$L \propto M^{11}$
