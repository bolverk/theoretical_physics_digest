In this entry we derive relations between different properties of molecular clouds. We assume that the velocity dispersion in molecular clouds is the result of turbulent cascade, so there is a power law relation between the velocity dispersion and the size of the cloud $\sigma \propto L^{\alpha}$. We can use this relation to estimate the relation between the virial mass and the size of the cloud
$ m \approx \frac{L \sigma^2}{G} \propto L^{1+2\alpha}$
The relation between the density and size of the cloud is given by
$ \rho \approx \frac{m}{L^3} \propto L^{-2\left(1-\alpha\right)} $
We can consider two extreme cases for turbulence. In the limit of a very subsonic turbulence we get [[Kolmogorov Turbulence|Kolmogorov spectrum]], so $\alpha = \frac{1}{3} $. In the limit of a very supersonic turbulence, we get [[Burgers Turbulence|Burgers turbulence]], so $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$. The power law index of the velocity dispersion - size relation is therefore bounded by

$\frac{1}{3} < \frac{d \ln \sigma}{d \ln L} < \frac{1}{2} $

The value inferred from [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981MNRAS.194..809L observations], 0.38, is within these limits.

The density - size power law index is bounded by

$ -1 > \frac{d \ln \rho}{d \ln L} > -\frac{4}{3} $

The value inferred from observations, -1.1, is within these limits.
