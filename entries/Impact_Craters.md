The purpose of this entry is to obtain a relation between the properties of an impactor and the size of the crater it creates. Upon impact, a shock wave emerges from the impactor - ground interface and travels downward. While the mass of the swept up material is lower than that of the impactor $ m<M_i$, the velocity remains comparable to the impact velocity $ v_i $. When the swept up mass greatly exceeds the mass of the impactor $ m \gg M_i$ then the velocity declines according to some power law in swept up mass

$ v \approx v _i \left(m/M_i\right)^{-\beta} $

The power law index is bounded by energy and momentum conservation $ 1>\beta>1/2$, and typically it is [https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06828 around 2/3]. To first order approximation, the radius of the crater is equal to the radius of the shock. Therefore, in order to determine the terminal radius of the crater, we need to determine where the shock stops. The initial pressure in the shock is much larger then the material stresses ahead of it, but as the shock expands and decelerates, and at some point the shock pressure becomes comparable to the stresses ahead of it. Beyond this point the wave that propagates would be an acoustic wave rather than a shock, which might produce a seismic signal but will not excavate a basin. 

The stresses ahead of the shock can be dominated by one of two factors. The first case is material strength. To deform a material, the pressure inside the shock must exceed its elastic modulus $Y$. Assuming both impactor and target have roughly the same density $\rho$, the relation between crater radius $R_c$ and impactor radius $R_i$ is

$ R_c \approx R_i \sqrt[4]{\rho v_i^2/ Y}$

where $v_i$ is the impact velocity.

The other factor that can limit the size of a crater is gravity, or hydrostatic pressure. For a planet with surface gravity $ g $, the terminal size of the crater is such that the velocity of the shock is not fast enough to hurl material over the rim of the crater

$ v^2 \approx g R_c $

Solving for $ R_c $ yields

$ R_c \approx R_i \left(\frac{v_i^2}{R_i g}\right)^{1/5} $

Assuming the impact velocity is similar to the escape velocity $ v_i^2 \approx G M_p/R_p $ where $ G $ is the universal constant of gravitation, $ M_p $ is the mass of the target planet, $ R_p $ is the mass of the target planet and surface gravity is $ g \approx G M_p/R_p^2 $ we find

$ R_c \approx R_i^{4/5} R_p^{1/5} $

When a target has both material strength and hydrostatic gravity, the radius of the crater is determined by the smaller estimate for the radius. This is why craters from small impactors are strength dominated, while large ones are gravity dominated.
