Fermi acceleration is a process by which particle are accelerated to super thermal energies. Usually, the spectrum of thermal distribution (e.g. Maxwell - Boltzmann, Maxwell - Juttner and Planck) decays exponentially for energies in excess of the thermal energy. Fermi acceleration usually adds a power law component to the distribution. 

The simplest mathematical model for Fermi acceleration is as follows. Suppose there's some process that can increase a particle's energy by a factor $ q>1 $. Suppose further that the probability for a single boost is $ 1>p>0 $. We are interested in particles at much higher energies than the thermal. For that purpose we can assume that all particles start with an energy $ \varepsilon_0 $. Hence, the number of boosts needed to get to an energy $ E \gg \varepsilon_0 $ is 

$ E = \varepsilon_0 q^n \Rightarrow n = \frac{\ln E/\varepsilon_0}{\ln q}$

The probability of having energy $ E $ is equivalent to the probability of experiencing $ n $ boosts

$ P\left(E\right) \propto p^n = p^{\ln\frac{E}{\varepsilon_0}/\ln q} = \left(\frac{E}{\varepsilon_0}\right)^{\frac{\ln p}{\ln q}}$

So the probability decreases as the energy increases.
