Thermal eccentricity distribution refers to the distribution of eccentricities of a population of binary stars, which is "thermalized" in some sense. This basic result in dynamics was derived by J. H. Jeans in his paper from 1919.

== Problem set up ==
Consider a population of binary systems, given sufficient time to achieve energy equipartition. This scenario is somewhat artificial, since interactions between binaries will likely to dissociate some pairs, while others will form triples. In this case, there could not exist a thermal distribution of binaries. The last paragraph will describe the consequences of this simplification.
