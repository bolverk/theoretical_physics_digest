The Paczynski Wiita potential is an approximate correction to the classical point mass gravitational potential that reproduces several effects of general relativity. The form of the potential is

$ \phi \left( r \right ) = \frac{G M}{r - r_c} $

where $G$ is the universal constant of gravitation, $ M $ is the is the mass, $ r $ is the distance from said mass and $ r_c = \frac{2 G M}{c^2} $ is the Schwarzschild radius. In the next section we derive the effects of general relativity reproduced by this potential. The rationale behind this potential can be easily understood. It diverges at Schwartzschild's radius, and tends to the non relativistic results at large radii.

== Innermost Stable Circular Orbit ==
Let us consider a circular orbit around a point mass with such potential. The orbital frequency is given by

$ \omega^2 r = \frac{G M}{\left( r - r_c\right )^2} \Rightarrow \omega = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{\left(r -r_c \right )r }} $

The energy of such orbit is given by

$ \frac{U}{m} = -\frac{G M}{r-r_c} + \frac{1}{2} r^2 \omega^2 = - \frac{G M}{2} \frac{r-2 r_c}{r-c_c} $

A minimum of the energy is obtained at $ r = 3 r_c $. At smaller radii the energy is higher. Hence, this is the radius of the innermost stable orbit.
