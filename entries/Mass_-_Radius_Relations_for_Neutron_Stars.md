This pages review theoretical bounds and estimates relating the mass $ M $ to the radius $ R $ of neutron stars.

== Black Hole Limit ==
If the mass of a neutron star become too large (or, alternatively, the radius becomes too small) then the neutron star would become a black hole. Hence, a neutron star must exceed Schwarzschild's radius

$ R > \frac{2 G M}{c^2} $

where $ G $ is the universal constant of gravity and $ c $ is the speed of light.
