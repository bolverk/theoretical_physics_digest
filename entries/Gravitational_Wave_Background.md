Let us consider a population of binary black holes whose orbit decays due to the emission of gravitational waves, and that will merge within a Hubble time. For simplicity, we will only consider symmetric binaries with masses $ M $ moving on circular orbits, and we ignore cosmological redshift. In this entry we calculate the gravitational wave spectrum from all these different binaries. In the classical approximation, the contribution to a frequency band around $ \omega $ comes from binaries whose semi major is

$ a approx \left(\frac{G M}{\omega^{2}}\right)^{1/3} $

To significantly change the orbital parameters, such binary has to get rid of an amount of energy comparable to its binding energy

$ E \approx \frac{G M^2}{a} \approx G^{1/3} M^{4/3} \omega^{4/3} $

If the density of these binaries is $ n $, then the energy density of the gravitational waves is $ u \approx n E $. From the energy density we can get the strain (see derivation in this entry on [[Pulsar Timing Array|pulsar timing arrays]])

$ \frac{c^2}{G} \dot{h}^2 \approx \frac{c^2}{G} \omega^2 h^2 \approx n E \Rightarrow h \approx \frac{\sqrt{n}}{c} \left(G M\right)^{5/6} \omega^{-2/3} $

Below a certain critical frequency, the binary does not merge within a Hubble time $ t_h $. This frequency can be computed using the [[Quadrupole Gravitational Radiation|quadrupole gravitational wave luminosity]]

$ L \approx \frac{G M^2 a^4 \omega^6}{c^5} $

$ L t_h \approx E \Rightarrow \omega_c \approx t_h^{-3/8} \left(\frac{G M}{c^3}\right)^{-5/8} $

We identify the second timescale $ G M/c^3 $ as the light crossing time of a black hole. For frequencies below the this value the calculation above breaks down because the binary does not have enough time to radiate an energy comparable to its binding energy. The energy density at a distance $ r $ away from a binary is

$ u \approx \frac{L}{r^2 c} $

We take $ r $ to be the average distance to the closest binary $ r \approx n^{-1/3} $, so again using the energy density we can calculate the strain

$ \frac{c^2}{G} \dot{h}^2 \approx n^{-2/3} \frac{L}{c} \Rightarrow h \approx N^{1/3} \frac{\lefT(G M\right)^{5/3} \omega^{2/3}}{c^4}$.

Thus, we get a spectrum that increases up to the critical frequency, and declines at higher frequencies.
