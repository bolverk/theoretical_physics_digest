Let us consider a disc that is illuminated and heated by the host star. The scale height of the disc is given by

$H \approx \sqrt{\frac{k T a^3}{G M \mu}}$

where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $a$ is the semi major axis, $G$ is the gravitation constant, $M$ is the mass of the star and $\mu$ is the mass of particles in the disc. A compact object in blackbody equilibrium with the radiation from the host star will have a temperature 

$T_{BB} \approx T_s \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{a}}$

where $R_s$ is the radius of the star and $T_s$ is the temperature at the photosphere. In the case of a disc, due to the oblique illumination, the temperature at the same distance from the star will be lower by a factor that depends on the angle between the tangent to the surface of the disc and the photon direction $H/a$.

$T \approx \left(\frac{H}{a}\right)^{1/4} T_{BB} \approx \left(\frac{H}{a}\right)^{1/4} \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{a}} T_s$

Plugging this in the expression for the scale height gives

$\frac{H}{a} \approx \left(\frac{k T_s R_s}{G M \mu}\right)^{4/7} \left(\frac{a}{R_s}\right)^{2/7}$

This expression can be further simplified by introducing the scale height on the star

$H_s \approx \frac{k T_s R_s^2}{G M \mu}$

and we get

$\frac{H}{a} \approx \left(\frac{H_s}{R_s}\right)^{4/7} \left(\frac{a}{R_s}\right)^{2/7}$

The disc flares up when $H \approx a$, which happens at

$a \approx \frac{R_s^3}{H_s^2}$
