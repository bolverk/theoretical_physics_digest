In the limit of a very small core, gravity is unimportant and the relation between radius and mass of a solid planetary core is roughly given by

$M \approx \rho R^3$

where $\rho \approx 1 \, \rm g/cm^3$ is a typical density of a solid. 

In the limit of a very massive planetary core, gravity is balanced by electron degeneracy pressure. To calculate the degeneracy pressure, we start from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \approx \hbar$

The uncertainty in position is comparable to the distance between neighbouring particles $\Delta x \approx n^{-1/3}$ where $n$ is the number density of electrons. The average thermal energy of an electron is given by

$\varepsilon \approx \frac{\Delta p^2}{m_e} \approx \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} n^{2/3}$

where $m_e$ is the mass of an electron. The degeneracy pressure is comparable to the energy density

$p_d \approx n \varepsilon \approx \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} n^{5/3}$

Comparing with gravitational pressure

$p_d \approx \frac{G M^2}{R^4}$

yields the following relation between the core mass and radius

$M \approx \frac{\hbar^6 Z^5}{R^3 G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5 A^5}$

where $Z$ is the atomic number, $A$ is the mass number, $m_p$ is the mass of the proton (which we assume is close enough to the mass of a neutron), and have used the following relation to obtain the nucleon number density

$\frac{M}{m_p R^3} \approx n \frac{A}{Z}$.

Surprisingly, the radius decreases as the mass increases. Therefore, by equation the two mass - radius relations we find an upper limit on the radius of a planetary core, and the mass at which it occurs

$R_c \approx \frac{\hbar \left(Z/A\right)^{5/6}}{\sqrt{G m_e} m_p^{5/6} \rho^{1/6}}$

$M_c \approx \frac{\hbar^3 \left(Z/A\right)^{5/2} \rho^{1/2}}{G^{3/2} m_e^{3/2} m_p^{5/2}}$

If we assume $Z/A \approx 1$, the value of the maximum radius is roughly [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(reduced+planck%27s+constant)%2Fsqrt((gravitation+constant)*(electron+mass))%2F(proton+mass)%5E(5%2F6)%2F(1*gram%2Fcc)%5E(1%2F6)%2F(earth+radius) 14 earth radii] and the critical mass is roughly the [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(reduced+planck%27s+constant)%5E3*(1*gram%2Fcc)%5E(1%2F2)%2F(gravitation+constant)%5E(3%2F2)%2F(electron+mass)%5E(3%2F2)%2F(proton+mass)%5E(5%2F2)%2F(saturn+mass) mass of Saturn].
