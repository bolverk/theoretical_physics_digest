Most stars occupy a very small volume in luminosity - mass space. In this section we will derive the analytic relations between those variables. We will assume that stars are characterised by a mass $ M $, radius $ R $, density $ \rho $, luminosity $ L $, typical temperature $ T $, typical pressure $ P $ and photon mean free path $ l $.
From the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium

$ P \propto \frac{G M^2}{R^4} $

The luminosity can be estimated in the following way: the energy density is assumed to be that of black body $ \frac{E}{V} = a T^4 $ where $ a $ is the radiation constant. The volume of the star is $ V = \frac{4 \pi}{3} R^3 $. The time it take a photon to cross is $ \tau \propto \frac{R^2}{l c} $. Hence the luminosity can be estimated as

$ L \propto \frac{E}{\tau} \propto l R T^4 $

The density can be expressed in terms of the mass and radius

$ \rho \propto \frac{M}{R^3} $

If the material is dominated by gas pressure, then

$ P \propto \rho T $

If, instead, the material is dominated by radiation pressure

$ P \propto T^4 $ 

If the gas is fully ionised, then Thomson opacity can be used

$ l \propto 1/\rho $

If not, then Kramer's opacity gives a better approximation

$ l \propto T^{7/2}/\rho^2 $

In the next sections we will discuss each combination.
