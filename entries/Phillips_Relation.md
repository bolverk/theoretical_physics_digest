Type Ia supernova are used as standard candles to measure distances in the universe. The Phillips relation can be used to infer the luminosity of a supernova from the shape of its lightcurve (the latter being independent of distance) and from the observed flux it is possible to infer the distance. In this entry we will describe the theoretical origin of this relation. 

Type Ia supernovae are powered by the decay of radioactive elements. These radioactive elements have lifetimes comparable or longer than the relevant timescales (to be discussed later on), and so we will simply assume that the energy generation rate is constant. Most of this energy is emitted as gamma rays, which cannot be observed directly from Earth's surface. A fraction of this energy interacts with the ejecta and is down - scattered to the visible range. At peak luminosity the optical depth is more than unity, so all the energy from the radioactive decay escapes as photons in the visible range. At later times the optical depth drops below unity, and from that point on, although the energy injection rate is the same, the luminosity in the visible range decreases like the optical depth. Historically, the Phillips relations parametrise the dimming rate by the difference between the magnitude of the transient at peak and fifteen days after peak

$ \Delta m_{15} \approx 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{L_p}{L_{15}} \approx -2.5 \log_{10} \tau_{15} + \rm const $

Since we are concerned with gamma rays, the opacity is dominated by Compton scattering, so that the optical depth scales as

$ \tau \approx \frac{\kappa M}{R^2} \propto M $ 

where $ \kappa $ is the opacity, $ M $ is the mass of the ejecta and $ R $ is the radius of the ejecta. We assume that the peak luminosity scales as the mass of the ejecta, and that the ejecta velocity is constant, so that the radius is also constant. Therefore, the relation between the peak magnitude $ m_p = -2.5 \log_{10} L_p \approx -2.5 \log_{10} M + \rm const $ and the magnitude difference is

$ m_p = \Delta m_{15} + \rm const $.
