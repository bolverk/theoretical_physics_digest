The main challenge with direct imaging of planets has to do with the fact that the blackbody surface irradiance is an increasing function of the temperature. This means that hotter objects emit more flux than cold objects, even at photon energies below the thermal energy $ h \nu < k T$. Since planets are smaller than their host stars, then the stars will outshine them at all photon energies.

Let us consider a planet with radius $R_p$ at a distance $r$ from a star of radius $R_s$. In this entry we calculate the ratio of luminosities between the two. For simplicity, we will neglect the case where the planet has residual heat, and assume that it is in radiative equilibrium with its host star. In this case, the ratio between the bolometric luminosities of the planet $L_p$ and the star $L_s$ is

$\frac{L_p}{L_s} = \frac{R_p^2}{R_s^2}$

If the albedo of the planet is 1 (i.e. the planet is perfectly reflective) then this is also the ratio of luminosities at every wavelength.

In the case of zero albedo (i.e. all the radiation is absorbed and re - emitted), the blackbody temperature of the planet is

$ T_p = T_s \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r}}$

Where $T_s$ is the temperature of the star. When observing the system in photon energies below the temperature of planet $h \nu<k T_p < k T_s$ the surface irradiance is given by the Rayleigh - Jeans law $ B_{\nu} \left(T\right) = k T \frac{\nu^2}{c^2}$ and the ratio of spectral luminosities is

$ \frac{L_{p,\nu}}{L_{s,\nu}} = \frac{B_{\nu} \left(T_p\right) R_p^2}{B_{\nu} \left(T_s\right)} = \frac{R_p^2}{R_s^2} \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r}}$

Since $ R_s<r $, then the zero albedo case will always be brighter than the fully reflective case.
