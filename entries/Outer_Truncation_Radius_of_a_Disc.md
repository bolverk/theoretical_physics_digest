Let us consider a protoplanetary disc around a star of mass $ M_s $ and radius $ R_S $. Suppose most of the light from the star is emitted at a temperature $ T_s $. Such photons will be able to unbind a gas particle of mass $ \mu $ at a distance $ a $ from the star if

$ k T_s/x > \frac{G M_s \mu}{a} $

$ a > a_t \approx \frac{G M_s \mu x}{k T_s} $

where $ x \approx 4.9 $ comes from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law Wien's displacement law]. We refer to this distance as the truncation radius, as we expect material to blown away from larger radii. This result can also be expressed in terms of the scale height at the surface of the star

$ H_s \approx \frac{k T_s R_s^2}{G M_s \mu} $

$ a > a_t \approx x R_s^2/H_s $ 

For a sun like star and a disc made up primarily of hydrogen, the truncation radius is about [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(gravitation+constant)*(solar+mass)*(proton+mass)%2F(boltzmann+constant)%2F(5800+kelvin)*4.9 90 au].

For accretion discs around black holes that emit close to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_luminosity Eddington luminosity] $ L_e \approx G M_s \mu c/r_e^2$ where $r_e$ is the classical electron radius, assuming the photosphere is similar to the gravitational radius $ R_g \approx G M_s/c^2 $, the effective temperature is given by

$ k T_s \approx k \left(L_e/\sigma R_g^2\right)^{1/4} \approx \hbar \frac{c}{r_e} \left(\frac{\mu}{M_s} \frac{r_e^2 c^3}{G \hbar}\right)^{1/4}$

where $ \sigma = k^4/\hbar^3 c^2 $ is the Stefan Boltzmann constant. The truncation radius in this case is

$ a_t \approx \frac{G M_s \mu x}{k T_s} \approx x r_e \frac{G M_s}{c^2} \rac{\mu c}{\hbar} \left(\frac{M_s}{\mu} \frac{G \hbar}{r_e^2 c^3} \right)^{1/4} $

The first three length scales in this expression are the classical electron radius, the gravitational radius, and the Compton wavelength of the proton.
