The TOV limit (named after Tolman, Oppenheimer and Volkoff) is an upper bound on the mass of a neutron star. The neutron star is supported against gravity by the strong force. Under the influence of the strong force, the distance between neighbouring nucleons is roughly given by the Compton wavelength of the pion

$ \lambda \approx \frac{\hbar c}{m_{\pi}} $

where $ \hbar $ is the reduced Planck constant, $ c $ is the speed of light and $ m_{\pi} $ is the pion mass. The mass density, also called the nuclear density, is therefore 

$ \rho \approx \frac{m_n}{\lambda^3} $

where $ m_n $ is the average mass of a nucleon. If too much material is added to the neutron star it collapses to a black hole. The radius of such black hole is given by the Schwartzschild radius

$ R \approx \frac{G M}{c^2} $

If such a black hole has nuclear density, its mass would be 

$ M \approx \frac{m_p}{\sqrt{m_n m_{\pi}^3}} $

where $ m_p \approx \sqrt{\hbar c/G} $ is the Planck mass. A more careful analysis puts this limit at around $ 3 M_{\odot} $.
