Lagrange points are equilibrium points in the presence of the gravitational field of two rotating point masses. We denote one point mass by $ M_1 $ and the other by $ M_2 $. We denote the separation between the two point masses by $ a $. The centre of mass lies between the two point masses, such that the distance between the first point mass to the centre of mass is $ r_1 = a \frac{M_2}{M_1 + M_2} $, and to the second is $ r_2 = a \frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} $. We choose an coordinate system whose origin coincides with the centre of mass, and whose x axis aligns with the line connecting the two point masses. The position of the first mass on this axis is $ \left( -r_1, 0 \right) $, and that of the second point mass is $ \left( r_2, 0 \right) $. In a co - rotating frame one must also take into account the centrifugal force. The rotation frequency is $ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{G\left(M_1+M_2\right)}{a^3}} $. Hence the potential (in polar coordinates) is

$ \varphi = -\frac{G M_1}{\sqrt{r_1^2+r^2+2 r r_1 \cos \theta}} 
-\frac{G M_2}{\sqrt{r_2^2+r^2 - 2 r r_2 \cos \theta}} - \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 r^2 $

This expression can be simplified by introducing dimensionless parameters $ \mu = \frac{M_2}{M_1} $, $ \xi = \frac{r}{a} $ and $ \hat{\varphi} = \frac{\varphi}{G M_1 / a}$.

$ \hat{\varphi} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\mu}{1+\mu}\right)^2+ \xi^2 + 2 \xi \frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \cos \theta}}
- \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{1+\mu}\right)^2+ \xi^2 - 2 \xi \frac{1}{1+\mu} \cos \theta}} - \frac{1}{2} \left(1+\mu \right) \xi^2
 $

It turns out that this expression has 5 extrema: 3 on the x axis (L1, L2 and L3) and 2 at an oblique angle (L4 and L5).
