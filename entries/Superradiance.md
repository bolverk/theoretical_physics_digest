Let us consider an atom with two energy levels. Suppose that an excited atom in isolation decays on a timescale $\tau_1$. According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the emitted photon energy will lie within an energy range whose width is $\Delta \varepsilon_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}$.

Now let us consider an ensemble of $N$ such atoms that lie within a single photon wavelength of one another. The ensemble can be considered as a single system with $N$ levels. The energy range of the emitted radiation is now $\Delta \varepsilon_N \approx N \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}$, so according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the duration of the emission is

$\tau_N \approx \frac{\tau_1}{N}$

If the energy of a single photon is $\varepsilon$, then the total energy budge of the ensemble is $N \varepsilon$, and the luminosity is

$L \approx N^2 \frac{\varepsilon}{\tau_1}$

For comparison, in the incoherent case, where the atoms are at distances exceeding the wavelength of the photon, the luminosity would is given by

$L_i \approx N \frac{\varepsilon}{\tau_1}$
