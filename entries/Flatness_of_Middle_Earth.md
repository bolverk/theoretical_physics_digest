The flatness of Middle Earth is a textbook<ref>S. Weinberg, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//abs/1972gcpa.book.....W Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications of the General Theory of Relativity], Wiley (1972) page 7 figure 1.1</ref> exercise in differential geometry. We are given the distances between any pair of 4 cities in Tolkien's fantasy world: Umbar, Hobbiton, Erebor and Dagorlad. The object is to check whether those distances are consistent with a flat space.

The table below gives the distances in miles.
