We consider a steady, isentropic, laminar fluid flow through a pipe whose cross sectional area changes continuously with time. We assume the flow is always along the axis of the pipe, and disregard motion perpendicular to the axis. In the next sections we derive relations between the area and the hydrodynamic variables for an ideal gas.

In steady state, the conservation of momentum reduces to

$ v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} +\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} = 0 $

where $ v $ is the velocity, $ \rho $ is the density, $ P $ is the pressure and $ x $ is the position along the pipe. We recall that the specific enthalpy is given by

$ dw = T dS + \frac{1}{\rho} dP $

Hence, for an isentropic flow

$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{2} v^2 + w \right) = 0 $
So the total enthalpy is conserved along the pipe. For an ideal gas the enthalpy is given by

$ w = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1} \frac{P}{\rho} $

where $ \gamma $ is the adiabatic index. Hence the following quantity is conserved along the pipe

$ \frac{1}{2} v^2 + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1} \frac{P}{\rho} = W_t $

The mass current is also constant along the pipe

$ J = A \rho v $

Plugging into the conservation of total momentum yields a relation between the pressure, velocity and cross sectional area

$ \frac{1}{2} v^2 + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1} \frac{A P v}{J} = W_t $
