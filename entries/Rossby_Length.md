Let us consider an atmosphere with height $ H $, on a planet with surface gravity $ g $. When a hot gas blob rises from the surface to one scale height, its average velocity is $ v_b \approx \sqrt{g H} $. Now let us consider two such blobs near 45 degree latitude. If the distance between the two points is $ L $, then the rotational velocity difference would be $ \Delta v \approx L \Omega $, where $ \Omega $ is the rotation period of the planet. Both velocities are equal when 

$ L \approx \frac{\sqrt{g H}}{\Omega} $

This length scale is sometimes referred to as the Rossby length, or the synoptic length.
