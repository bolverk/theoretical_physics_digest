Given a binary in a circular orbit in which one of the stars undergoes a supernova explosion, there is a maximal amount of mass that may be lost in the explosion such that the system remains bound.

Assume a binary composed of stars of masses: $ M_1^0, M_2 $ that are moving in a circular orbit with semi major axis $ a_0 $. The first star explodes in a supernova, and losses an amount of mass: $ \Delta M=M_1^0-M_1 $. We further assume that the explosion is spherical symmetric and due to conservation of momentum, no "kick" is given to the exploding star, and its velocity immediately after the explosion remains constant.

The energy before the explosion is:

$ E_0=-\frac{G M_1^0 M_2}{2a_0}=-\frac{1}{2}\mu_0 v_0^2 \rightarrow \frac{GM}{a_0}=v_0^2$

where $ \mu_0, M, v_0 $ are the reduced mass, total system mass and relative velocity before the explosion accordingly and where in the second equality we use the fact that in a circular orbit $ E_p=-\frac{1}{2}E_k $. 

After the explosion, the energy is:

$ E=-\frac{GM_1 M_2}{2a}=-\frac{GM_1 M_2}{a_0} +\frac{1}{2}\mu v_0^2 $

where $ a$ is the semi major axis of the system after the explosion and we have used the fact that right after the explosion the separations and relative velocities have not yet changed.

The limiting case for a post-explosion bound orbit ($ E<0 $) is given when $ E \rightarrow 0 $ (or equivalently $ a \rightarrow \infty $). At this limit:

$ -\frac{GM_1 M_2}{a_0} +\frac{1}{2}\mu v_0^2=0 \longrightarrow \frac{G (M-\Delta M)}{a_0}=\frac{1}{2} v_0^2 $

Plugging in $ v_0^2 $ we obtain: $ \frac{G (M-\Delta M)}{a_0}=\frac{G M}{2a_0} $, leading to $ \Delta M=M/2 $. Therefore, if the exploding star loses more than half of the mass of the system in the supernova, it will become unbound.
