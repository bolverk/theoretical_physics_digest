Let us consider a star with mass

$M$
and radius

$R$
and luminosity

$L$
. Suppose that in the interior of the star the energy is transported by convection. Let us denote by t the time it takes a fluid element to get from the centre of the star to the edge. We call it the convective timescale. The average velocity is therefore

$R/t$
, the kinetic energy is

$MR^2/T^22$
. and the kinetic luminosity is

$M R^2/T^3$
. Equating the radiative and kinetic luminosities yields

$t = (M R^2/L)^{1/3}$

For the sun, this timescale is of the order of [http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%281+solar+mass%29*%28solar+radius%29%5E2%2F%28solar+luminosity%29%29%5E%281%2F3%29 a year]
