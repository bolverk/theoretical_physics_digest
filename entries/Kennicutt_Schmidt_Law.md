Let us consider a molecular cloud that gravitationally collapses to form stars. The amount of mass available to form stars scales linearly with the mass density of the cloud $ \rho $. The rate of collapse is given by the Jeans timescale $1/\sqrt{G \rho}$ where $ G $ is the constant of gravity, so the star formation rate per unit volume scales with the mass density as 

$ \rho_{\rm SFR} \propto \rho^{3/2} $

In practice, mass density (and star formation density) per unit volume are difficult to measure, so this rule is typically written in terms of density per unit area

$ \Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \Sigma^{3} $

This power law is not to different from the value [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennicutt%E2%80%93Schmidt_law inferred from observations] $ d \ln \Sigma_{SFR} / d \ln \Sigma \approx 0.4 $.
