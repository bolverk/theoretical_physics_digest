Let us consider an accretion disc around a spinning black hole. Suppose the angular momenta of the disc and black hole are misaligned. Due to [[Lense Thirring Precession|Lense Thirring precession]], the line of nodes of each annulus in the disc rotates in the equatorial plane of the black hole at a rate

$\omega_{lt} \approx \frac{G J}{c^2 a^3}$

where $J$ is the black hole's angular momentum, $G$ is the gravitation constant, $c$ is the speed of light and $a$ is the semi major axis. In an accertion disc, matter slowly flows inward toward the black hole at some velocity $v_r$ (see section below), so it spends a time $t \approx r/v_r$ at radius $r$. If the precession frequency is $\omega_{lt}$, then the rotation angle of the line of nodes is given by

$\alpha \approx \omega_{lt} r/v_r \approx \frac{G^{6/5} J M^{1/5} \mu^{4/5} \sigma^{1/5}}{a^{8/5} c^2 k^{4/5} \dot{M}^{2/5} \alpha^{4/5} \kappa{1/5}} \approx \frac{G^{6/5} J M^{1/5} \mu^{4/5}}{a^{8/5} c^{12/5} h^{3/5} \dot{M}^{2/5} \alpha^{4/5} \kappa^{1/5}}$

This changing nodal angle gives rise to a spiral pattern in the disc. A illustration of this pattern can be seen in the pictures to the right.

=== Radial Velocity ===
Assuming Shakura Sunyaev $\alpha$ model for the disc, the diffusion coefficient is given by $\nu \approx \alpha \Omega H^2$ where $\Omega \approx \sqrt{G M/a^3}$ is the Keplerian frequency, $G$ is the gravitation constant, $M$ is the mass of the central object, $a$ is the semi major axis and $H$ is the scale height. The diffusion time is given by

$t_d \approx \frac{a^2}{\nu} \approx \frac{a^2}{\alpha \Omega H^2}$

Dividing the semi major by the diffusion time yields the radial velocity

$v_r \approx \frac{a}{t_d} \approx \alpha \Omega H^2/a$

The scale heigh $H$ is related to the temperature $T$ through 

$k T \approx \frac{G M \mu H^2}{a^3}$

where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\mu$ is the mass of the gas particles. The temperature is determined by the condition of equilibrium between the heating rate due to viscosity

$L_h \approx \frac{\Sigma \Omega^2 a^4}{t_d}$

and cooling through blackbody emission

$L_c \approx \sigma a^2 T^4/\tau$

where $\Sigma$ is the surface mass density, $\sigma$ is the Stefan Boltzmann constant, $\tau \approx \kappa \Sigma$ is the vertical optical depth and $\kappa$ is the opacity. The surface density can be related to the accretion rate $\dot{M}$ via the conservation of mass

$\dot{M} \approx a^2 \Sigma v_r$

We can now obtain an expression for the radial velocity as a function of radius

$v_r \approx \frac{k^{4/5} \dot{M}^{2/5} \alpha^{4/5} \kappa^{1/5}}{a^{2/5} G^{1/5} M^{1/5} \mu^{4/5} \sigma^{1/5}} \approx \frac{\hbar^{3/5} c^{2/5} \dot{M}^{2/5} \alpha^{4/5} \kappa^{1/5}}{a^{2/5} G^{1/5} M^{1/5} \mu^{4/5}}$

where $\hbar$ is Planck's constant.
