The paradox of youth concerns the presence of young main sequence stars very close to the galactic black hole (approx 3 pc radius). These stars could not have formed there, because such stars form in a molecular cloud, and the cloud could not have withstood the tidal forces. Assuming a density of $ n = 10^4 cm^{-3} $ and black hole mass of of $ M_{\bullet} = 4 \cdot 10^6 M_{\odot}$, a cloud can only survive at a radius greater than

$ r > \left( \frac{M_{\bullet}}{m_p n} \right)^{1/3} \approx 25 pc$

(the substitution can be found [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%284e6+solar+mass%29%2F%28proton+mass%29%2F%281e4+%2Fcc%29%29^%281%2F3%29%2F%281+parsec%29 here]). The other option is that they formed elsewhere, and migrated to their current location.
